# Experiments - 2020-05-22 - Lineage Analysis

Goal:

- Select cross section for phylogeny tracking/analysis
  - Mutation distributions over time for successful lineages
  - Question: do different mutation rates/change rates have different distribution?

Parameters (2 x 3 x 2) x 50reps

- Fitness model: gradient, nk
- Change rates: 0 (static), 1/4, drift
- Mutation rate: 0.003, 0.03
- 50k generations, no phase 2
