# 2020-05-21 Experiment - Environment transplants

Are architectures evolved in changing environments more evolvable?

Experiment
  - Evolve: static environment (x200), 1/4 changing environment (x100), drift environment (x100)
    - Take architectures from 1/4 changing and drift, evolve in static environments
    - Compare: static @ 60k, 1/4 changing in 10k static, drift in 10k static

PHASE 1

- Evolve 200 static environment for 60K generations.

OUTCOME

- Organisms evolved in a static environment are generally maximally fit (for 16, 32, and 64 genes) or
  close to maximally fit => There's not room for improvement by more modular architectures.
