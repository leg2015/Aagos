- For both static and changing environments (and nk and gradient fitness models):
  - Evolvability in low mutation rate environment
    - Phase 1: Low mutation ==> Phase 2: Low mutation
    - Phase 1: High mutation ==> Phase 2: Low mutation
  - Evolvability in high mutation rate environment
    - Phase 1: Low mutation ==> Phase 2: High mutation
    - Phase 1: High mutation ==> Phase 2: High mutation
