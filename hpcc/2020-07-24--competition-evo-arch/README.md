# Competition Experiment

Procedure

1. Evolve a 100 replicate populations under high mutation rate in environment X and 100 replicate
   populations under low mutation rate in environment X.
2. 'lift the wall': pair these together (double population size?), evolve 100 paired replicates under
   high mutation rate conditions in environment X and 100 paired replicates under low mutation
   rate conditions in environment X.

Phase 1
  - specify the common environments (generate)
  - allow architectures to evolve
Phase 2
  - transfer ENTIRE populations (doubling the population size) in full
  - allow architectures to evolve
