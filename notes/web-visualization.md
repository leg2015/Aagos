# AAGOS Web Visualization

Current version of the web visualization for these experiments can be found at <https://lalejini.com/Aagos/web/Aagos.html>

## Ideas

- Show the most fit individual over time compared between a few different change rates so folks can
  more easily see how the average length/number of coding sites depends on the change rate/mutation rate.
- Guarantee color blind friendly gene coloring options if possible? Or add another visual differentiation
  between genes.
- In addition to population and most fit view, visualize the lineage of the most fit organism (or starting
  at MRCA) over time.
- Implement NK fitness model in visualization? We'd need to work out how to show the NK fitness table,
  which might be sort of visually incomprehensible (at a glance) at large gene sizes.
- Color genomes/genes based on fitness contribution
  - higher = brighter, lower = darker/dimmer
- Add demos with hand-designed architectures
- Add feature to sort the order of organisms by length of genome for visual clarity
- Save visual snapshots, implement replay slider to allow playbacks across generations
