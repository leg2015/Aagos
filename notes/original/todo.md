# Potential add-ons to experiment

## Runs with smaller N
* N = 32, 64

## Circular environments
* could vary length of cycle
* cycle of length 2  = that paper I can't remember we talked about in our meeting
* also could have implications for catastrophic forgetting

## lineage metrics
* could explore some of the lineage metrics emily's been working on w/ system

## gradual vs abrupt changing environments
* see if the magnitude of change between environments has an effect
* could give some granularity on environmental change between generations
* ie: do smaller magnitude environmental changes lead to more modularity than larger changes

## Fitness of evolved agents in changing environments vs static
* evolve agents in both static, changing env.
* give env of static agent to evolved changing agents, evolve and see if evolved agent fitness outperforms static agent
* need agents to have lower fitness than optimal, ie N = 64
* evolve with both fixed gene locations, evolvable gene locations

## non-uniform probability of point mutations
* suggested at alife, motivated by different regions of genome in biology have differing mutation rates

## Trying different mutation rates

## lethal / devastating states

## adding neutrality

## adding slip mutations

## variable length genes
