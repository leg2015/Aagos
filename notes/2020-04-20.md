# Notes from 2020-04-20

We completed our sweep of mutation rate and environmental change rates for both gradient and NK fitness
models. Both fitness models produced qualitatively similar results.

- Environmental change selects for more modular (more gene spread) genomes
  - *up to a point where there are so many changes the environment is essentially random from generation
    to generation
- High mutation rate selects for more compact genomes

## Analyses

- What does evolution care about?
  - Look at distribution of architecture types

## Meeting todos

- Go over next steps
  - Can we narrow further than current?
- Review mutation tracking implementation?
- Publication target (writing todos/strategy)

## Next steps

- Narrow experiment scope (avoid full sweep of mutation rates and change rates)
- Vary gene count (8, 16, 32)
- Hand-design architectures, evolve for 10k generations in static environment
  - Expect more spread out architectures to achieve better fitness at low mutation rates
  - At high mutation rates, expect more compact genomes to perform better?
  - Architectures
    - 100% coding
    - 75% coding
    - 50% coding => half genes full overlap, all genes overlap half
    - Full overlap => all genes fully overlap
- Random drift controls
  - I.e., set tournament size to 1
- Lineage tracking - look at mutation distributions [implemented]
  - Interesting: stacked area plot for mutation types (moves, flips, ins, dels, etc)
- Heat map of coding sites vs mutation rate (fitness after 10k or 1k gens as heat)
  - Architectures locked for evolution
  - How do we want to generate architectures?
    - 1 option `[i for i in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(16), 4)]`
      - issue: 0,0,0,0 is same as 15,15,15,15

## Experiments

### Part 1

- Pivot mutation rate: 0.003
- Pivot change rates: 64, 2, 0
- ~~Starting genome size: 32, 64, 128, 256~~
- Fitness models: gradient model & nk model
- At anchor points, gene counts: 8, 16, 32 (shift starting genome size appropriately)
- Random drift treatment for each mutation rate, gene count, & starting genome size
  - + turn selection on after 50k generations of drift! TODO
- Large replicate count: 100

- From prior experiments:
  - varying bit flip mutation rates, static environment
  - varying bit flip mutation rates, change rate of 50
  - varying bit flip mutation rates, change rate of 2
  - Mutation rate = 0.003, varying change rate

- Not run different starting positions

### Part 2

- Environment transfers

### Part 3

- Hand-designed architectures

## Extensions/Background

- Vanilla Avida experiments?
  - First, read Rose's changing environment work
    - ALife paper: <https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/978-0-262-33936-0-ch047>
    - More EQU-only functional sites at harsh changing environments
    - Thesis: <https://search-proquest-com.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/docview/2007551841?pq-origsite=gscholar>
  - Or, actually AEVOL?

## Future work

- Consider EC followup
  - Our results suggest that we should evolve populations in a changing environment (for a solid architecture)
    and shift to a static environment.
